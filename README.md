# Awesome HRI Datasets and Human Simulators

This list is curated because _testing human robot interaction is difficult_.

## HRI Datasets

- PinSoRo [[paper]](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0205999)[[project page]](https://freeplay-sandbox.github.io/) - a large (120 children, 45h+ of calibrated RGB-D video recordings), open-data dataset of child-child and child-robot social interactions; contains annotations of social constructs, 3D recordings of the faces, skeletal informations, video and audio recordings, and game interaction logs.
- MHHRI [[paper]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8003432)[[project page]](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/rainbow/projects/mhhri/) - developed for studying personality simultaneously in human-human interactions (HHI) and human-robot interactions (HRI) and its relationship with engagement; contains data, audio, video, depth, EDA, temperature, 3-axis wrist acceleration sensor data and self-/acquaintance-assessed personality, self-reported engagement measures for 2 human-human and 3 human-robot interactions (total 6hrs).
- P2PSTORY [[paper]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3173574.3174008)[[project page]](https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/p2pstory/overview/) - contains (i) time-synchronized video and audio recordings, (ii) behavior, and prosodic feature annotations, and (iii) demographic and socio-emotional development profiles, and subjective measures of children's perceived the effectiveness of their interaction partner in terms of attention and understanding.
- UE-HRI [[paper]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3136755.3136814)[[project page]](http://www.tsi.telecom-paristech.fr/aao/en/2017/05/18/ue-hri-dataset/) - dataset of spontaneous interactions between a robot and humans, of which 54 interactions (between 4 and 15-minute duration each); contains various levels of engagement annotations and subjective ratings of the interaction.
- GoLD [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.14987.pdf) - a multimodal dataset of common household objects described bypeople using either spoken or written language.
